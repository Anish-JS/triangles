# triangles
mark12

This is an app built using HTML, CSS and JS where it kind of covers a lot of things about triangles. There's a quiz, a demonstration of the pythogoras theorem to find the hypotenuse 
of a right-angled triangle, a section which checks whether the angles add upto 180 to determine whether it is a triangle and finally there's also a section which can be used to find
out the area of a triangle
